DMDc utilizing OpenFAST/OpenFOAM simulations. Will be compared to LSTM based control and predictions.

This repository now includes a MATLAB demonstration of Dynamic Mode Decomposition with control (DMDc) using artificial sine and cosine signals:

* `basic_DMDc_demo.m` â€“ Hankel-DMDc example using delay embedding and the pseudoinverse.
